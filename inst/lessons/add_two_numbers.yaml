lesson_name: "Writing Your First Function"
description: "Learn to write a simple function that adds two numbers"
textbook_reference: "Just Enough Software Engineering - Chapter 2: Functions"

exercise:
  type: "function_writing"
  code_template: |
    # Write a function called 'add_two' that adds two numbers
    # Function should take parameters x and y
    # Function should return their sum

    add_two <- function(x, y) {
      # Your code here

    }
  prompt: |
    Write a function called 'add_two' that takes two numeric arguments
    (x and y) and returns their sum.

  example_usage: |
    add_two(3, 5)  # should return 8
    add_two(10, -2)  # should return 8

  success_criteria: |
    - Function is named 'add_two'
    - Takes exactly 2 parameters
    - Returns the sum of the parameters
    - Handles numeric inputs correctly

  llm_evaluation_prompt: |
    You are evaluating student code for a software engineering course.

    Exercise: Write a function called 'add_two' that takes two numeric
    arguments and returns their sum.

    Student submitted this code:
    {student_code}

    Evaluate the code and call the respond_with_feedback function with your assessment.
    Set is_correct to true if the code meets all requirements, false otherwise.
    Provide brief, encouraging feedback (2-3 sentences) in feedback_message.
